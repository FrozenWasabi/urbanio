## BusInTransit
Bus In Transit is a program coded on processing with many GUI elements a user interacts with. The program is designed to simulate the movement of buses and the transportation of people in a city represented with a map. The program considers certain changeable variables including a time cycle for traffic alterations, people’s aggressiveness in terms of how much they may be above or below the speed limit and the city’s population. The program also has some interesting built in features including infrastructures which are correlated with the amount of people at a bus stop as well as the adjacent road speeds. There are also cars along with buses which affect the road traffic including busing delays as well as people who get on the buses, wait, or leave based on the capacity and delays of the bus.
